### About Me

Currently I am a Senior Data Scientist at GitHub and prior to that I was a Senior Data Analyst at Heroku. You can learn more about my professional history [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandermatheson/).

Over the last couple years I have transitioned to building internal tooling and infrastructure for Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers. I love this space because of the impact that we can have on the efficacy of Data Science and Machine Learning teams. The prospect of building tooling that will allow data scientists to more effectively use GitHub to get their work done is extremely exciting. 

I love working with the Python ecosystem, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Jupyter and massively parallel computing for Data Warehousing and Analytics.
