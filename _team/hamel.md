### About Me

I am currently a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at GitHub.  Previously, I was a machine learning engineer at [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) and [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/).  Prior to that, I was a management consultant.  

Recently, I led the development of [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) with the [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) community.  I also led GitHub's [CodeSearchNet](https://github.com/github/codesearchnet) project, and am a contributor to Kubeflow.  

Throughout my history as a data scientist, I have been most frustrated by the lack of tools and infrastructure for machine learning.  This led me to develop a keen interest in creating tools that can mimize toil for data scientists.

You can find more information on my other projects and interests on [my page](http://hamel.io/).

### Favorite tools

Bash Scripting, VSCode, Python, Jupyter, Keras, Altair, fastai, pytorch, Docker, DataRobot, GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages.
