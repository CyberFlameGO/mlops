### About Me

I am currently a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at GitHub.  Previously, I was a machine learning engineer at [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) and [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/).  Prior to that, I was a management consultant.  

Recently, I led the development of [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) with the [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) community.  I also led GitHub's [CodeSearchNet](https://github.com/github/codesearchnet) project, and am a contributor to Kubeflow.

Throughout my history as a data scientist, I have been most frustrated by the lack of tools and infrastructure for machine learning.  While there are many devops and other automation tools that serve mainstream software development (i.e. deploying a website), many do not fit the use case of machine learning very well.  

This led me to develop a keen interest in creating tools that can mimize toil for data scientists, and make the process of prototyping, developing, scaling, testing and measuring data products easier.

You can find more information on my other projects and interests on [my page](http://hamel.io/)
