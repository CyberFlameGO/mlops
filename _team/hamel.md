### What drew you into machine learning ops?

Throughout my history as a data scientist, one of the things I have been most frustrated by is the lack of tools and infrastructure for machine learning.  While there are many devops and other automation tools that serve mainstream software development (i.e. deploying a website), many do not fit the use case of machine learning very well.  

This led me to develop a keen interest in creating tools that can mimize toil for data scientists, and make the process of prototyping, developing, scaling, testing and measuring data products easier.

I've worked on machine learning infrastructure at [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/), [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

### Who have you learned from or been inspired by?

I learned a great deal from past and former colleagues at [places that I have worked](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamelhusain/).  I've also learned a great deal from the [fastai community](https://www.fast.ai/), both as a student and a contributor.
