### About Me

I lead Open Source Machine Learning Strategy at Azure. This means I spend most of my time helping humans to convince machines to be smarter. I am only moderately successful at this.

Previously, I led product management for Kubernetes on behalf of Google, launched Google Kubernetes Engine, and co-founded the Kubeflow project. I have also worked at Microsoft, Amazon and Chef and co-founded three startups.

You can find more information about me on [my page](https://www.davidaronchick.com/).
