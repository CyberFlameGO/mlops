I am only moderately successful at this. Previously, I led product management for Kubernetes on behalf of Google, launched Google Kubernetes Engine, and co-founded the Kubeflow project. I have also worked at Amazon and Chef and co-founded three startups. My Mission: I believe, above all, that we have a responsibility to the future and that we must help technology be beneficial to humanity. We have seen technology do some amazing things. But, we’ve also seen technology misused, misapplied, or just plain broken. Technology is NOT neutral; we must actively use it for good. My Favorite Tools: I use Chrome almost constantly during the day (armed with LastPass), with VS Code and OneNote for random notes. Outlook Web Acces and Gmail with Gmail key bindings are critical for processing mail quickly. For development, I use Kubeflow with Docker (for local development), Kubernetes (for cloud) and Draft with a Jupyter notebook, and VS Code for this as well.

Throughout my history as a data scientist, I have been most frustrated by the lack of tools and infrastructure for machine learning.  This led me to develop a keen interest in creating tools that can mimize toil for data scientists. You can find more information on my other projects and interests on my page.
