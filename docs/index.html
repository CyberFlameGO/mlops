If you are unsure on whether or not your content is appropriate for this site, please open an issue. What is MLOps?: From Wikipedia:  MLOps (a compound of “machine learning” and “operations”) is a practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to help manage production ML (or deep learning) lifecycle. [1] Similar to the DevOps or DataOps approaches, MLOps looks to increase automation and improve the quality of production ML while also focusing on business and regulatory requirements. While MLOps also started as a set of best practices, it is slowly evolving into an independent approach to ML lifecycle management. MLOps applies to the entire lifecycle - from integrating with model generation (software development lifecycle, continuous integration/continuous delivery), orchestration, and deployment, to health, diagnostics, governance, and business metrics. How Can GitHub Help With MLOps?: There are a series of new and emerging features that can aid with MLOps.  Some feautres that are relevant incldue Actions and CodeSpaces. "

I am only moderately successful at this. Previously, I led product management for Kubernetes on behalf of Google, launched Google Kubernetes Engine, and co-founded the Kubeflow project. I have also worked at Amazon and Chef and co-founded three startups. My Mission: I believe, above all, that we have a responsibility to the future and that we must help technology be beneficial to humanity. We have seen technology do some amazing things. But, we’ve also seen technology misused, misapplied, or just plain broken. Technology is NOT neutral; we must actively use it for good. My Favorite Tools: I use Chrome almost constantly during the day (armed with LastPass), with VS Code and OneNote for random notes. Outlook Web Acces and Gmail with Gmail key bindings are critical for processing mail quickly. For development, I use Kubeflow with Docker (for local development), Kubernetes (for cloud) and Draft with a Jupyter notebook, and VS Code for this as well.

    "body": "Experiment tracking for machine learning involves logging of metrics and artificacts associated with different training runs.  This is essential for effective mlops as it allows you to track your performance metrics and promotes reproduceability in a transparent, reuseable way. There are several experiment tracking systems available as third-party solutions that GitHub Actions can integrate with.  For example, the below example illustrates how results of a training run can be fetched from Weights and Biases and dropped into a pull request: &lt;/img&gt; "

<h2 id="what-is-mlops">What is MLOps?</h2>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MLOps (a compound of “machine learning” and “operations”) is a practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to help manage production ML (or deep learning) lifecycle.[1] Similar to the DevOps or DataOps approaches, MLOps looks to increase automation and improve the quality of production ML while also focusing on business and regulatory requirements. While MLOps also started as a set of best practices, it is slowly evolving into an independent approach to ML lifecycle management. MLOps applies to the entire lifecycle - from integrating with model generation (software development lifecycle, continuous integration/continuous delivery), orchestration, and deployment, to health, diagnostics, governance, and business metrics.</p>
